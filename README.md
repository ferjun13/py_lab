# py_lab
A collection of Python projects and experiments: from algorithms and simulations to small games and utilities.

🚀 About

This repository is my personal Python lab — a place where I explore ideas, practice coding, and build small projects. You’ll find a mix of:

🧬 Algorithms & simulations (evolutionary algorithms, optimization, etc.)

🎮 Games & playful experiments

🛠️ Utilities & scripts for everyday use

📚 Learning projects where I try out new concepts

📂 Structure

Projects are organized into folders. Each folder contains:

Source code (.py files)

A README.md (if the project needs extra explanation)

Requirements (if dependencies are needed)

🛠️ Requirements

Most projects run with just Python 3.x.
If a project requires extra libraries, you’ll find a requirements.txt inside its folder.

📌 Notes

This repo is for learning, experimentation, and fun.

Code quality may vary across projects, since some are just quick prototypes.

💡 Future ideas

Add more games

Explore machine learning basics

Create automation scripts
